# Hospital RAG System

This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that 
processes an Excel sheet containing data for the Pain & Go hospital, including information on 
physicians, schedules, and pricelists. The system's role will be to answer user inquiries, such as 
the schedule of a specific doctor, the most appropriate doctor or specialty based on the question
It uses a Flask API, Streamlit UI, and SQLite database to answer user queries about doctor schedules.
